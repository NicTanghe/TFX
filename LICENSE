this is not free and unencumbered software.

almost all code is owned by Nicolaas Tanghe and anny use of it requires permission from nicolaas tanghe
there are exceptions like anny code i didn`t write wich include the cookie code wich was written by Lazy
and all the original boilerplate code also the css for the glowing button and all of the axum example code.



If you want to use this code talk to me or get me an income so i can give this a more permissive license.
